//Problem-1

Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ 
if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, 
without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).

//PSEUDO CODE

MAIN

      state integer variable N
      Prompt input of N from user

While
     N>=0
     subtract 3 from N and give it to N
     N=N-3
END While

If
  N=0
  Print response
      "True"
else
    Print response
       "False"
END if
