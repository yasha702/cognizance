//Problem-2

Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number. 
(Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦

//PSEUDO CODE

MAIN
    
    initialise first variable (a) = 0
    initialise second variable (b) = 1
    initialise third variable (c) = 0

    Prompt the input of Nth number from user

For(variable i ranging from 1 to Nth number)
 
   Add the values of 'a' and 'b' and assign it to Fib
   Assign the value of 'b' to 'a'
   Assign the value of 'Fib' to 'b'

END For
    
      Print 'Fib'
