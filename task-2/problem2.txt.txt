//Problem-2
Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number.
(Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦)

The Fibonacci numbers are numbers in the following sequence,
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89.....

 F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1

//PSEUDO CODE
MAIN

     Initialize first number(a) to 0
     Initialize second number(b) to 1
     Initialise third number(c) to 0

     Prompt the input of Nth number from user

For (variable i ranging from 1 to Nth number)
     Add the values of 'a' and 'b' and set it to 'Fib'
     set the value of 'b' to 'a'
     Assign the value of 'Fib' to 'b'
END For

     Print Fib

END MAIN
